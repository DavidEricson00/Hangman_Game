<h2>📌 Objectives</h2>
<p>
This project is developed entirely in Python with the aim of further enhancing the basic concepts of the language (such as using libraries, strings, functions, etc.) and learning about how the GitHub platform works.
</p>

<h2>💫 About the Project</h2>
<p>
The project features two game modes: Player vs Player, where one person can challenge another, and Player vs Machine, where the program presents a random word to be guessed.
</p>
